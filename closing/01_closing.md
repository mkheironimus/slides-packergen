"Dynamic templating" means more advanced variable expansions, macros, etc.

People have written lots of similar tools for CloudFormation, but AWS uses JSON
all over the place.

Some people throw around the term "DSL" really freely. Here it means a real
workflow configuration language (maybe using a Grammar), not just JSON or Ruby
with a library.
